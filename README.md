This is a lightweight audio analyzer, using the Steinberg ASIO protocol for spectrum analysis of a multichannel audio-stream.
The intended use-case of this application is in a live audio engineering setup, and therefore focuses on lightweight, quick setup and operation, as well as a great usability.

The GUI uses JavaFX with some custom built elements to display the data.

Added some useful functions to access infos from church, since this is my primary use.
